DFS-based approach:
* Kosaraju's algorithm ([code](include/strongly_connected_components.hpp))

    Complexity:
    
    Time: $O(V + E)$ or $O(V^2$) if graph represented as adjacency matrix
    Memory: $O(V + E)$ or $O(V)$ if graph represented as adjacency matrix
        where V - is number of vertices and E - is number of edges
